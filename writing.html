	<h1>My Experience with Writing </h1>

	<h2> All through high school I loved to write, but decided to begin taking my writing seriously when I got to college. Freshman year, I spent time writing for Moda Magazine. Moda is a student run lifestyle magazine that covers lifestyle and fashion.</h2>

	<p> Currently, I write for The Daily Cardinal, a student run newspaper that covers news locally. I write for the campus news desk where I cover happenings at the university. I have written just over ten pieces for my editor at this desk.</p>
